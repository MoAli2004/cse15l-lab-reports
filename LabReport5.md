# Lab Report 5
Welcome to CSE 15L Lab Report 5. For this weeks lab report we're told to create ad debugging scenario and a reflection.

## Part 1- Debugging Scenario
For this part I was unable to really get the time to create a scenario because I had to attend to a personal matter that had left me in a difficult position leading me to fall a little behind (at a really inconvenient time). Due to the things that I had to deal with I am very sorry for not being able to create my own scenario for this lab report.

## Part 2- Reflection
Something that I learned from my lab experience during the second half of this quarter would be the grading script that was used in lab during week 8 because I was able to see how our work could possibly be graded and also being able to mess with it made lab that week very fun to me as I was able to see how little changes could affect how effective the script would work.
